Postmodernism is a confusing thing that is kind of not a thing.  In terms of
architecture, it's fairly clearly defined, so we'll start there.

The Haas-Haus in St. Stevens Square, Vienna is postmodern.  This is largely
because it is a building built in 1988-90 which is able to fit *well* into
its surroundings (Gothic, Baroque, turn of the century, 1950's Modern,
etc.).  It has windows that reflect some of the older buildings, so that it
is both new (reflective glass and metal) and old (a reflection of centuries
old buildings).  It bends around a corner, blending both into back street
architectural style and main, central square, shopping center sort of
architecture.  The building is a sort of 'symbiosis' of past, present and
future.

An important postmodern feature in architecture is double coding, where the
interests and desires of the architect AND the client are both met in one
building.  This leads to things like banks built to look like a weird
functional mix of classical Greek architecture and functional modern bank
architecture.  Other key words are 'pluralism' and 'semiotics.'

The Ritterstrasse Apartments in Berlin-Kreuzberg combines a sort of flat
Tuscan style, symmetrical, with a striking lack of windows (helping to
define the inside as private space separate from the urban space in front of
the building).  Over the doorway is also a classical caryatid which is
damaged, commenting on the new and the old in Berlin.

Also postmodern: the Neue Staatsgalerie, Stuttgart.  Kiasma Art Museum,
Helsinki.  most recently built art museums, lots of recently built things in
Berlin, many Disney buildings, etc.

In literature, it's a little less graphic.  Basically, it's kind of a move
away from modernism which was very focused in the mind of a single
individual (often) including dreams and images and personal journeys.
Modernism was also fascinated by the city and modern advances, machines,
etc.  Modernism also generally tended to be a pretty upper class thing.
Many modernist artists were trained in classical languages and "the canon."
This generally means that modernism generally didn't come from women, young
people, any third world countries, any non-white people, any poor people,
etc.  Postmodernism has kind of gone hand in hand with an opening up of
post-colonial territories, re-evaluating the canon (for example why did it
exclude so many good works of literature? and who got to decide what was in
it and what did they have at stake?).  Postmodernism has also proceeded with
feminism, an appreciation of diversity in race and culture and religion and
world-history-views.

While modernism tended to focus on epistemology [How to interpret the world?
Our place in the world? What is there to know? Who knows it? How? How sure
are they?  How is knowledge transmitted?  What are the limits of the
knowable?], postmodernism focuses on ontology [Which world is this? What is
to be done in it?  Which of my selves is to do it?  What is a world? What
kinds of worlds are there, how are they constituted, and how do they differ?
What happens when worlds are in confrontation or boundaries are violated?
Text versus world?

Typical modernist devices: juxtaposition of perspectives, focalization of
all the evidence through a single 'center of consciousness', virtuoso
variants on interior monologue, etc.

Typical postmodernist devices: multiple/parallel worlds, worlds under
erasure, mises-en-abyme, excessive metafiction, etc.

Some authors known for writing postmodern works: Italo Calvino, Umberto Eco,
(maybe Gunther Grass' The Flounder), Vladimir Nabokov, Flann O'Brian, Thomas
Pynchon, Ishmael Reed, Kurt Vonnegut Jr., Salmon Rushdie, (maybe Peter
Handke), Jan Kj¾rstad, Toni Morrison, etc.
